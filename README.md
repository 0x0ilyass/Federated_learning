This project implements and compares several optimization algorithms for federated learning in a simulated distributed environment. The goal is to evaluate and analyze the performance of these algorithms on classification tasks with heterogeneous clients.

The implemented algorithms include:

FedAvg

FedAdam

FedProx

Local SGD

The experiments are designed to study metrics such as global accuracy, communication overhead, robustness, and scalability.
